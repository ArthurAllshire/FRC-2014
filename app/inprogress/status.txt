Status:
- Working on input parser, input as nested associative array
- Working on multiple plots for each graph
- Genall and Getall not yet fixed


===================What it does at this point===================
-Nothing. Its Broken.
Problem ==> Cannot push this to scs array in the add(value, handler) function: parseFloat(value[0]['y'])
	Where value = json encoded php array:
		$array = array(
			array(
				y => $rand
			),
			array(
				y => $rand * 2
			)
		);
Probably should put the parser in its own functionâ€¦
