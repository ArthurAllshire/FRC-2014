Status:
- Has horrible input parser
- Only 1 plot per graph
+ Fixed an issue where graphs looked weird when switching tabs
+ Multiple Tabs, Multiple graphs Supported
- Gets data thru json, no socket, just a JQUERY getJSON request every 1 second
- SCS array (Stored Chart Settings) has all chart settings and data.
- Needs functions getall and genall to be intuitive based on SCS content, also genall should generate only(!) the graphs on the current tab.
- Should not have to declare handler outside of SCS

===================What it does at this point===================
-Graphs Multiple graphs with only one data input for all the graphs (needs to be fixed)

-Tabbed View
