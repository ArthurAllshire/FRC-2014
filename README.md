Like last year, we used the Netbeans IDE to write the Java codebase for 2014's Aerial Assist. This repository can be conveniently opened in Netbeans, otherwise all of our code lives in src/ inside of packages that are organized by unctionality.

Looking for a good starting point? Take a look at [com.team254.ChezyCompetition](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2014/blob/master/src/com/team254/frc2014/ChezyCompetition.java).

### com.team254.frc2014
 * **Constants.java** contains constants correspondong to ports, PID values, and shooter speed. These can be accessed, but not modified, by the rest of the codebase.
 * **ChezyCompetition.java** subclasses the IterativeRobot template in order to inherit periodic and disabled states. It handles logic for disabled, autonomous, and tele-operated states.
 * **Automode.java** is a abstract class 'template' for each autonoumos mode stored in package [com.team254.auto](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2014/blob/master/src/com/team254/auto).
 
###com.team254.frc2014.hotgoal
* **CheesyVisionHotgoalDetector.java** is the code on the robot that communicates with [CheesyVision](https://github.com/Team254/CheesyVision), a webcam based hotgoal detection ssystem.
