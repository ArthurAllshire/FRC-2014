Like last year, we used the Netbeans IDE to write the Java codebase for 2014's Aerial Assist. This repository can be conveniently opened in Netbeans, otherwise all of our code lives in src/ inside of packages that are organized by unctionality.

Looking for a good starting point? Take a look at [com.team254.ChezyCompetition](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2014/blob/master/src/com/team254/frc2014/ChezyCompetition.java).

### com.team254.frc2014
 * **Constants.java** contains constants correspondong to ports, PID values, and shooter speed. These can be accessed, but not modified, by the rest of the codebase.
 * **ChezyCompetition.java** subclasses the IterativeRobot template in order to inherit periodic and disabled states. It handles logic for disabled, autonomous, and tele-operated states.
 * **Automode.java** is a abstract class 'template' for each autonoumos mode stored in package [com.team254.auto](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2014/blob/master/src/com/team254/auto).
 
### com.team254.frc2014.hotgoal
* **CheesyVisionHotgoalDetector.java** is the code on the robot that communicates with [CheesyVision](https://github.com/Team254/CheesyVision), a webcam based hotgoal detection system.

### com.team254.frc2014.paths
* **AutoPaths.java** is a class that reads paths for autonomous from files using com.team254.lib.TextFileReader

### com.team254.frc2014.subsystems
Representations of aspects of the robot with methods for retrieving source values and checking / setting the state of the subsystem.

### com.team254.frc2014.controllers
State machines and state space controllers that control the flywheel and drivebase.

### com.team254.frc2014.auto
Holds all of the autonomous routines. The autonomous mode can be selected at drivers station using com.team254.frc2014.AutoModeSelector

### com.team254.frc2014.actions
Holds actions that the robot is supposed to do in a specific time
* **Action.java** is an abstract calss 'template' for all actions

### com.team254.lib
Holds miscellaneous classes. Some to note are:
 * **ControlOutput.java** Result of calculations performed by the controller on the ControlSource.
 * **ControlSource.java** Data collected by sensors in a subsystem.
 * **ControlUpdater.java** Runs in its own thread and periodically checks up on all subsystems using their ControlSource to affect the ControlOutput.
 * **ChezyIterativeRobot** is a slightly modified version of the Iterative Robot
 * **ChezyHTTPServer** is a HTTP Server for the robot that creates JSON objects of data (categorized by subsystem).

### com.team254.lib.util
Miscellaneous utility classes.

### com.team254.lib.trajectory
Trajectory generation and following classes.

### com.team254.lib.trajectory.io
Parses paths from strings


Other Contents
--------------
* **The Data Logger** is a webapp built to log data on a graph coming from the robot via HTTP reguests that return JSON. (See com.team254.lib.ChezyHTTPServer for JSON generator or app/json.php to generate random json)
